# Covid-19-Research-Development

This repository contains the code and datasets that were used to analyse and model Covid-19 data for Indian states.

This analysis has tried to answer the some questions regarding thr covid-19 crisis in India, as they are important and relevant in the current socio-economic climate. Through this analysis, we also aim to resolve some of the personal misconceptions that we had about COVID-19. One's ability to answer each of these questions would depend, signicantly, on their understanding of the disease, from:
- an epidemiological perspective
- a statistical perspective

To strengthen the statistical understanding of the disease variants of the popular SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model were used:
- Time-Dependent SIR
- SIRV (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, Vaccinated)

Using this approach, we have provided a framework to develop vaccination strategy, assess potential impact of vaccination & calculate the Herd-Immunity Threshold to curb spread of disease
